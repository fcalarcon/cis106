* Current directory: the directory where you are at the moment; present working directory 
* Parent directory: moving backwards to the previous directory

## What is the right to repair movement and why does it matter?

The right to repair is being able to go to someplace other than the manufacturer or dealer to repair a product if you chose to do so. Its important because it allows us to repair devices for a fraction of both the money it would normally cost in having them repaired from the manufacturer and as well as the time they would normally take.
