## Question 5
The Cutefish OS project was submitted August 2021 and is currently pending evaluation. It focuses on making a better desktop experience by making it simple, beautiful and practical. Also promises to be secure and stable. It seems very promising and covers all of my requirements. Most desktop are practical but not cute at all. It is open source so anyone can try to understand how it works and collaborate.
